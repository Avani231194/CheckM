# Pending move to Python 3

Python 2 is reaching [end of life](https://pythonclock.org/) on January 1, 2020. CheckM has been ported to Python 3 to accomodate deprecation of Python 2. The official CheckM release will be updated to v1.1.x on Dec.1, 2019. CheckM v1.1.x will require Python 3 and there are no plans to support Python 2 moving forward. Apologies for any issues this may cause.

If you wish to use the Python 3 port of CheckM now you can find it on the python3_dev branch of this repository.

# Installing and using CheckM

Please see the project home page for usage details and installation instructions:

Note: we do not recommend installing CheckM from the master branch. This may be unstable. Please install an official release of CheckM or use pip.
