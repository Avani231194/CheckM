        <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>One of the problems faced in metagenomic assembly is the uncertainty
that collections of contigs that have been 'binned' into putative
genomes may be contaminated from another organism or represent an
incomplete genome.  Both are major problems that need to be addressed
before inferences about metabolic function can be made by the presence
or absence of genes. CheckM, is a set of tools that can assess the 
contamination and completeness of genome bins using conserved genes found
in a single copy for different taxonomic lineages.  More closely 
related bacteria and archaea share a higher proportion of their gene
complement and therefore estimations of completeness based on these
markers will be more accurate than estimates based on gene markers
that are universal. </p>

<h1>Installation and Dependancies</h1>

<p>CheckM requires both <code>biopython</code> and <code>simpleHMMER</code> python packages be
intalled as well as <code>hmmer3</code> binaries to be in your <code>PATH</code>.  With those
dependancies filling download the git repository to your system and run</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<h1>Running Instructions</h1>

<p>CheckM has a single executable <code>checkM</code> that has a number of
subcommands.  There are three subcommands that the use will use
regularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>build</code> - Run <code>hmmer</code> of a marker set against genome(s) of interest</li>
<li>
<code>qa</code> - Filter <code>hmmer</code> results and output a summary</li>
<li>
<code>align</code> - Align identified markers against the HMM model
CheckM can be run in two different ways.  First is for the user to
supply a <code>hmmer3</code> compatible model file of markers.  The second way is
to build a database of markers for all taxonomic lineages and use those
markers for accurate estimates of completeness and contamination.  By
default CheckM prefers to use the later of the two options.</li>
</ul><h2>Setting up the Database</h2>

<p><code>checkM</code> has a subcommand called <code>makeDB</code> that will take freely
available genomic data and calculate the conserved markers for each
taxonomic lineage.  To generate the database you will need to download
the genomes from IMG and have the Pfam-A domains as well.</p>

<p>Assuming that you have either made a database you should set the path
with the environmental variable <code>CHECKM_DB</code>.  To check whether this is
already set, try the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $CHECKM_DB
</code></pre>

<p>If you see a file path then the CheckM database is already set up on
your system.  Otherwise you can setup the database using the following:</p>

<pre><code>export CHECKM_DB=/full/path/to/your/checkm_database
</code></pre>

<p>To make that setting perminant add the above line into your <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<h1>Marker Sets</h1>

<p>Marker sets are a list of genes/protein domains that are found in all 
genomes for a particular taxonomic rank.  Some marker sets may be 
universal or be specific to a family or genus.  There are two marker
sets that get used routinely; one from
<a href="http://phylosift.wordpress.com">phylosift</a> that contains 37 markers
that are universal, and a list compiled by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22170421">Dupont et al.
(2012)</a> which
contains 111 markers found in the majority of Bacteria. A more accurate
view of contamination and completeness of a genome bin may be achieved
by using markers that are targeted to a particular microbial lineage.</p>

<h2>Generation of taxon specific marker sets</h2>

<p>The taxon specific marker sets that are used by CheckM were generated
using the metadata from the IMG 4.0 release.  First all of the complete
genomes were separated based on the taxonomy string found in the
metadata.  Next the prevalence of pfam domains for each taxon with at
least 5 genomes was calculated todetermine which were found in at least
95% of all genomes.  This list of domainswas further segregated based on
whether that pfam was strictly single copy in each genome or not.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<ul>
<li>These lists use pfams, which means that a marker may not represent a whole
gene.  For example there may be two markers, one from the C-terminal and
the other from the N-terminal domain of the same protein. </li>
<li>using a minimum of 5 genomes for a taxon is probably too low.  Be careful
about how specific a marker set you use.  Think about the total number of
genomes that the list was constructed against, if in doubt use a Domain
or phylum level marker set.</li>
<li>based solely on the genomes found in IMG 4.0</li>
<li>I haven't done any annotations myself, I'm relying solely on the annotation
pipeline in IMG</li>
<li>The taxonomy is also straight from IMG and this may be inaccurate (maybe?),
which would throw off all of the calculations </li>
</ul><h2>Using Taxon Specific Marker Sets</h2>

<p>Taxon specific marker sets can be invoked by using the <code>-T</code> option on
the command-line.  The taxonomy must be the full taxonomy in Greengenes
format, for example: <code>k__Bacteria;p__Proteobacteria</code>.  Spaces are also
allowed between taxonomic ranks: <code>k__Bacteria; p__Proteobacteria</code>. To
get a universal marker set (common to all bacteria and archaea) use the
special taxonomy 'universal' as the argument to <code>-T</code>
NOTE: Do <strong>not</strong> specify a taxonomy that is lower than the genus level!</p>

<h1>Workflow</h1>

<p>This is a workflow that I use for determining the completeness and
contamination of all of my genome bins.  First start by using one of the
universal marker sets such as the markers used by phylosift or by
specifying the taxonomy as 'universal' in the <code>-T</code> flag of `checkM.</p>

<pre><code>checkM build -T universal &lt;OUTPUT_FOLDER&gt; genome.fna 

checkM qa -T universal &lt;OUTPUT&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>From the output of the <code>qa</code> command you should be able to see which bins
are 'near complete'.  As a general rule I only look genome bins that are
at least 80% complete and less than 10% contamination.  From this point
I make a tree using the concatenation of the  markers and determine the
putative taxonomy of my genome bins. </p>

<p>For example lets assume that one of your genome bins is a
<em>Rhodocyclacae</em> based on the taxonomy in the tree.  Now we can use the
specific single copy genes for <em>Rhodocyclacae</em> to get more accurate
statistics on completeness and contamination. (There are 428
<em>Rhodocyclacae</em> specific single copy genes, verses the 39 universal)</p>

<pre><code>checkM build -T 'k__Bacteria;p__Proteobacteria;c__Betaproteobacteria;o__Rhodocyclales;f__Rhodocyclaceae' &lt;OUTPUT_FOLDER&gt; genome.fna

checkM qa -T 'k__Bacteria;p__Proteobacteria;c__Betaproteobacteria;o__Rhodocyclales;f__Rhodocyclaceae' &lt;OUTPUT_FOLDER&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This output should be a more accurate view of the contamination and completeness of your genome.</p>
